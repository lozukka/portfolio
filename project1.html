            <h3>What?</h3>
            <p>I coded a very basic classic WordPress theme. First, I took an introductory course and followed code-along tutorials on how to build a classic WordPress theme. After that, I designed my own theme. I used the same concept for the site: a fictional environmental club. In this theme, I created layouts, page structures, and used the loop function to display content on the page. The code can be found on my GitHub page.</p>

            <h3>Why?</h3>
            <p>I wanted to learn something new about WordPress. The basic course we had at school was very simple and beginner-friendly. When I found the theme development course, I decided to give it a try. It was eye-opening to learn how themes used to be made â€” and in many ways, the process is still similar today. I find my very first theme kind of funny and outdated, but I learned a lot from building it.</p>

            <h3>What I learned</h3>
            <p>I learned the fundamentals of theme development. I also created a small plugin during the course, so I gained some experience with plugin development as well. On the technical side, I learned to use PHP code and worked with a lot more CSS than I had before this project. I am especially proud of the navigation I built.</p>
